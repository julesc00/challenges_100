2.1.3 Short Introduction to Prime Numbers

    A prime number is a natural number that is greater than 1 and exclusively divisible by
    itself and by 1. There are two quite understandable algorithms for checking whether a
    given number is prime or for calculating primes up to a given maximum value.

    Brute force algorithm for prime numbers Whether a number is a prime number or
    not can be determined as follows. You look for the number to be checked starting from 2
    up to at most half of the number, whether the current number is a divisor of the original
    number.2 In that case, itâ€™s not a prime.
